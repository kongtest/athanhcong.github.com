I was reading "Founders At Work" few days ago, and was stunning how hard writing software was, at the time of Steve Wonizak and Bill Gates.

Back to days of 1980, owning a personal computer is much like owning a "personal sattelite" today. Programming at the day is very different from today, there was no computer programming language.

I remember, in a movie, the first program Bill Gates wrote for Atari 8800 was in a paper tape. He made software by puching holes on a tape? It seems hard to imagine for young developers.

Even back in the day Steve Wonizak worked, he wrote computer game by hardware! He was working with logic circuits and chips to make his own game. 
At that time, I think there are only a few people on earth who know how to make software.

Things changed so much, writing software now become much more popular. Many school trains people how to write software. To become "software engineer", you can go to almost any university, spend 4 years learning about computer and programing.

IT becomes one of the hotest jobs around the world.
We all hear about the "new" job title __software engineer__, who are writing code, as much familiar as we hear about marketer, who are working with event, commercials... to get products visible to customer mind. Designer who make beautiful and useful looking for products, and so on.

The stunning is happened, more and more people, who does not specialize on programing, know how to code.

In web company, there was time when, designer's job mainly is designing a nice full frame of the website, and finishes by slicing the graphical elements for developer. Now it makes sense that a __designer__ knows how to code HTML, CSS and even Javascript. They need to turn their graphics into browser code.

__Writer__ also can code. The web becomes a good medium for writers to reach their audience. Writers have tastes and they want to own the designs for their website. Some of them now can write simple PHP and HTML themes for Wordpress.

When working on education game, I was so surprised that many __parents__ are writing software for their kids, themself!

In Silicon Valey companies, like Facebook, there is a hot job title call ["Growth Hacker"](http://andrewchen.co/2012/05/11/how-do-i-learn-to-be-a-growth-hacker-work-for-one-of-the-guys/), the one whose responsibility is getting more and more users (customers) for their products. Is this marketer? Yes it is, but with a slightly difference. This is a __marketer__ who can code, who know how to integrate marketing process into product to make it much more viral. A product which can be viral by itself, is the product can win customers.

Everyone will know how to code? This change starts at software companies. In our time, software continues to influence every aspects of society and technology are easy and easier to use. If __coding is not for a job, but turns to be a personal skill__, let's see how far this can go. 

There was a day, when people dreams that they can use computer!
