I finished Steve Jobs book a 2 days ago. Then starting to think about what is the best thing he left to human after he gone.

It's not the Macbook, iPhone, or iPad…

Yes, these are great products. Many of us are using and loving them. I love them, too. But these products will not stay with us long, they will be replaced by other people' products, one day.

So ...?

#The Jobs Legacy

Jobs achieved many great things in life. He made revolution on many industrials. His products really push human being into a better place.

He self-made his millionaire, and being so famous. But for the things he did, he did them, NOT for money.

If not money, then __why?__

> What drove me? I think most creative people want to express appreciation for being able to take advantage of the work that’s been done by others before us. I didn’t invent the language or mathematics I use. I make little of my own food, none of my own clothes. Everything I do depends on other members of our species and the shoulders that we stand on. And a lot of us want to contribute something back to our species and add something to the flow. It’s about trying to express something in the only way that most of us know how – because we can’t write Bob Dylan songs or Tom Stoppard plays. We try to use the talents we do have to express our deep feelings, to show our appreciation of all the contributions that came before us, and to add something to that flow. That’s what has driven me

His life is giving us a proof that __there has a better and more meaningful way to live our life: build great things.__

I believe this is the most meaningful thing that he left to next generation.

Jobs's story began by "2 friends working on their products in a garage", and then become the most valuable company in the world. This story is so inspiring. 

It's about 30 years since their start, today we can see there has a trench that, almost all people in Technology field, want to start their own startup, or involve into one.

We all have different motivations to working in a startup. However, I believe many of us have a vision to build things, to solve human problems, and to change the world.

Passion or Money, Fame... - Whatever motivate people is, at the end of journey, we will all realise that "building great things, is always a better and more meaningful way to live our life"
