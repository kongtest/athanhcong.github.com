People I meet in Singapore always want to ask me how do I feel living in Singapore? I usually say I like it, the working environment here is very good. Today I tell you the full story of my last year in Singapore, and how I like it.

I came to Singapore with the eagerness to travel. A year ago, I decided that I need to travel. I'm ambitious, I'm young but I don't know what to do with this energy, so traveling is the answer.

Singapore is very different with Vietnam, it likes chaos vs well-managed. Living standard here is higher. I still feel how eager I felt when I just came here. How I make [friends at the first day](http://kong.vn/ngay-dau-o-singapore/), and accept to go for a picnic with them to one of the farthest island of the country, just because I believe Singapore is safer.

I work in a co-working space, where our colleague can meet other startup cool guys, feel the energy of the guys who working everyday until midnight, they only leave when knowing that they gonna miss the last bus.

Most of the time I'm staying Singapore, I'm staying in my office. Here is when the interesting part started.

### Unsettle down
I start to stay in the office as a temporary option when I was finding my own room. But later, I found that I keep stay in office. Staying in office is still weird in Singapore, at least I don't know any other do it in Singapore. And yes, it always puts me into an embarrassing moment when people asking me where do I stay? Also, how to treat with workers in nearby cubic, how they was surprised when knowing that I'm sleeping nearby. Luckily, I have a good boss at Stickery, good friend at PlugAndPlaySingapore and NUS Plugin.

Why I choose to do this? After fist few weeks in office, I realised that I like the feeling of temporary here. I like the curious feeling that I had when I just came to Singapore. It's so cool, and I want to keep it, I don't want to settle down. I need to keep remind me, so I officially unsettle.

### Keep learning
Staying in office helps me lot of things. It's help me save money, save travelling time, I just need to wake up, and can work already. But more important, I help me minimise my life (live lean) and get over my social shamefulness.

Yes, after 10 months training with "staying-in-office" weird situation, I finally get some achievement in controlling my social shamefulness. I no longer strongly feel shy when telling about a weird situation or an awkward moment. I'm more honest to myself and people.

Living in office also forces me to live as a minimalist. I barely buy things, material things. When I buy something, I try to think twice: how to reuse it for different purposes, what I can remove, or replace. I came here with 1 backpack, and still can leave fully with that same backpack. Surely, many of my friend gifts are still kept in my table.

My life is also in minimal in to main activities: work, sleep, eat, run. Keep focus myself into the things that matters. Remember to call dad, Kong!

### Taking even more risk
This month, something big happened. I left my job. I want to focus more for my project, a new startup. My real adventure is happening now.

This is a risk decision, not only because Singapore is an expensive country, I may need salary to survive. But also, in the fundamental, the risk is I may need to leave Singapore, the place where helped me learn so much.

Starting a new business is always unpredictable, you don't know where it can go? how to you find your team member, who are willing to fight with you, how do you take the responsibility with the people you hired, how to survive…

If you ask me am I confident? I say yes, because I know the important things I need to do for my life, I focus and I work hard. More over, I still keep my belief on [why I choose this path](http://kong.vn/its-right-time-for-startup/).

And I believe failure is not the worst thing for me now. What gonna kill me is the feeling that I don't dare to do what I believe, that I'm not honest to myself, don't trust myself.

Life is unpredictable, and I also have no big plan. Life starts with an adventurous step.
